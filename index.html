        <div class="subheading mb-5">Music Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Music has been a major part of my life and aspect of my culture growing up. Every adult relative around in life always played 
        types and genres of music that I never heard before and it intrigued me. It continued where in my highschool days I was obsessed with learning about the making, 
        processing and releasing of popular music. Even now I still continue to learn through albums and singles from artists I have never heard off. 
        I am absolutely obsessed with music.<br><br>

        It all started when I entered into a music program in third grade and I chose to 
        play the drums then transitioned into playing the guitar. We practiced for a few 
        weeks and were then placed into a performance to a crowd. It would show how we developed 
        over time and I was also a duo with another student who played guitar and we both 
        had a part to learn where I went first then my partner wnet second, but on the day of the performance 
        he didn't show up. I was nervous and confused at the same time and had the option to cancel 
        my performance and just allow the other students to perform their songs. I decided not to and 
        actually practiced the 2nd part beforehand because I genuinely wanted to learn both parts. 
        I went on as the only student in the program to perform alone and managed to do it. 
        It was the beginning of my performance and overall music career and has impacted me in 
        every decision I do with music.<br><br>

        Now I study music at University of Riverside, California and major in music to continuously study and research music as well as specifically study 
        in composition and the music industry. I work on my certain styles of music and projects in my music portfolio ready for any work and job opportunities.
